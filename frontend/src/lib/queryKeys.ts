/**
 * Centralized query key factory for React Query.
 *
 * This module provides a single source of truth for all query keys used with
 * TanStack Query. Using a factory pattern ensures:
 * - Consistent key structure across the application
 * - Type-safe query key generation
 * - Easy cache invalidation by key prefix
 * - Organization-scoped keys for multi-tenant support
 *
 * Convention:
 * - All keys are readonly arrays
 * - Organization-scoped keys include orgId as the last element in an object
 * - Use factory functions for parameterized keys
 *
 * Usage:
 *   import { queryKeys } from '@/lib/queryKeys';
 *
 *   // In a hook:
 *   useQuery({
 *     queryKey: queryKeys.analytics.overview(orgId),
 *     queryFn: () => analyticsAPI.getOverview(),
 *   });
 *
 *   // Invalidate all analytics queries:
 *   queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: queryKeys.analytics.all });
 *
 * @module queryKeys
